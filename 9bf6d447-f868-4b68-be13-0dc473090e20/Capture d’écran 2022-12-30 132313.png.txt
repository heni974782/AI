Abstract. In this paper we present some experiments to automatically clas-
sify online handwritten text based on capital letters. Although handwritten
text is not as discriminative as face or voice, we still found some chance for
gender classification based on handwritten text. Accuracies are up to 74%,
even in the most challenging case of capital letters.

Keywords: on-line handwriting, gender recognition, capital letters, de-
identification.
